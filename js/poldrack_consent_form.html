    <h1>Research Study Participation Information</h1>

    <p class="section-title">DESCRIPTION:</p>
    <p>You are invited to participate in a research study on decision making, which seeks to understand human decision making and behavior. We hope to learn more about cognitive mechanisms that support various decisions people make every day, such as decisions about what tasks to do and how to do them. You will be asked to do an online experiment where you will be asked to attend to stimuli presented from a computer (usually visual or auditory) and then make a response (either by typing or clicking) based upon the stimuli. You will be asked to make responses in one or more of the following conditions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Respond based upon your preferences between different presented options.</li>
        <li>Respond as quickly and accurately as possible to stimuli that are presented in succession.</li>
        <li>Learn a set of stimuli and later respond based upon your memory of the stimuli that you learned.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You may also be asked to fill out some questionnaires or surveys during the experiment.</p>

    <p class="section-title">TIME INVOLVEMENT:</p>
    <p>Your participation will take approximately 10 to 120 minutes.</p>

    <p class="section-title">RISKS AND BENEFITS:</p>
